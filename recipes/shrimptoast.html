    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        The secret to this semi-traditional dim sum favorite is a butter-studded shrimp 
        mousse that comes together quickly in a food processor with just five ingredients.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8oz peeled and devined raw large shrimp</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>3 1/2 tsp toasted sesame seeds, divided</li>
        <li>6 white bread slices, crusts removed</li>
        <li>Canola oil, for frying</li>
        <li>1/2 scallion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp sambal oelek</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced scallion, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine shrimp, egg and salt in a food processor; process until smooth,
            about 15 seconds, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Add butter
            and 2 tsp sesame seeds; pulse until smooth with flecks of butter
            remaining, about 7 times. Spread 1/4 cup shrimp mousse on each bread slice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour oil into a large nonstick skillet to a depth of 1/8 inch; heat over 
            medium until shimmering, about 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Working in batches, 
            add bread slices, mousse side down; cook until lightly browned, about 2 
            minutes. Flip toasts; cook until browned and mousse is firm to the touch, 
            about 1 minute. Transfer to paper towels to drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir together chopped scallion, soy sauce, vinegar, sambal oelek, and 
            remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons sesame seeds in a small bowl. Cut each toast into 
            8 triangles; transfer to a platter or board. Serve soy sauce mixture with 
            toasts. Garnish toasts with sliced scallion, and serve.
        </li>
