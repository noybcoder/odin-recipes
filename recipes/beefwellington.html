    <img src="../images/beef-wellington.jpg" alt="A picture of beef wellington">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Named after Arthur Wellesley, the 1<sup>st</sup> Duke of Wellington, the dish is
        essentially a beef tenderloin wrapped in layers of pâté, duxelles (a finely chopped
        mushroom mixture), parma ham, and puff pastry, then baked.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>a good beef fillet of around 1kg/2lb 4oz</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>250g/9oz chestnut mushroom</li>
        <li>50g/2oz butter</li>
        <li>1 large sprig fresh thyme</li>
        <li>100ml/3.5 fl oz dry white wine</li>
        <li>12 slices prosciutto</li>
        <li>500g/1lb 2oz pack of puff pastry, thawed if frozen</li>
        <li>a little flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks beaten with 1 tsp water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 220<sup>o</sup>C/428<sup>o</sup>F</li>
        <li>
            Sit the beef fillet on a roasting tray, brush with 1 tbsp and season 
            with pepper, then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for 
            medium. Remove the beef from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge 
            for about 20 mins.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnut mushrooms as finely as 
            possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil and 50g of butter in a large pan and fry the 
            mushrooms on a medium heat, with 1 large sprig fresh thyme, for about 
            10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season the mushroom mixture, pour over 100ml dry white wine and cook
            for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture
            should hold its shape when stirred.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme.</li>
        <li>
            Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 
            slices prosciutto on the cling film, slightly overlapping in a double row.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread half of the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on
            it and spread the remaining duxelles over.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the cling film's edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then
            roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten
            it as you go.
        </li>
        <li>Chill the fillet while rolling out the pastry.</li>
        <li>
            Dust the work surface with a little flour. Roll out a third of the 500g pack
            of puff pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Roll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry to about 28 x 36cm.</li>
        <li>
            Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the center of the
            smaller strip of pastry.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat 2 egg yolks with 1 tsp water and brush the pastry's edges, and the
            top and sides of the wrapped fillet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Trim the joins to about 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or
            spoon handle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife mark the
            beef Wellington with long diagonal lines.
        </li>
        <li>Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200<sup>o</sup>C.</li>
        <li>
            Brush the Wellington with a litte more egg yolk and cook until golden and 
            crisp - 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef, 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand
            for 10 mins before serving in thick slices.
        </li>
