    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Five simple ingredients – cream, vanilla, salt, eggs and sugar – make for an 
        exquisitely rich and elegant dessert. Most crème brûlée recipes require the 
        use of a small propane torch to achieve the crackly sugar top, but this version 
        offers a simpler (and safer) solution: your oven's broiler. One thing to note: 
        Be sure to let the custard set for several hours in the refrigerator before 
        brûléeing the top, otherwise you'll end up with soupy custard.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of heavy or light cream (or half-and-half)</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>5 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar, plus more for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the oven to 325<sup>o</sup>F. In a saucepan, combine cream, vanilla
            bean and salt; cook over low heat just until hot. Let sit for a few 
            minutes, then discard vanilla bean. (If using vanilla extract, add it now).
        </li>
        <li>
            In a bowl, beat egg yolks and sugar together until light. Stir about a
            quarter of the vanilla cream into this mixture, then pour sugar-egg
            mixture into cream and stir. Pour into four 6oz ramekins and place
            ramekins in a baking dish; fill dish with boiling water halfway up
            the sides of the ramekins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until centers are barely set. Cool
            completely. Refridgerate for several hours and up to a couple of days.
        </li>
        <li>When ready to serve, top each custard with about a tsp of sugar.</li>
        <li>
            Place ramekins in a broiler 2 to 3in from heat source. Turn on broiler.
            Cook until sugar melts and browns or even blackens a bit, about 5 mins.
        </li>
